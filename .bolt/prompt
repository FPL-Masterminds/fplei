For all designs, make them beautiful and production-ready - not generic or cookie-cutter. Pages should feel polished, fully featured, and worthy of a real product launch.

When using client-side hooks like useState or useEffect, place them properly in functional components. You donâ€™t need "use client" since this is a React project, not Next.js.

Do not write code that triggers this error:
"Warning: Extra attributes from the server: %s%s 'class,style'"

By default, this template uses JSX with Tailwind CSS classes, the shadcn/ui component library, React hooks, and lucide-react for icons. Do not add other libraries for UI themes, icon sets, or components unless I specifically request them.

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.
